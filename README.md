**(Half-completed) podcast-oriented MP3 player for Java ME & Nokia Series 40**

Before I got my first Android phone, I had a Nokia 2730c running their [Series 40](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_40) operating system. Occasionally I wanted to use it as a backup MP3 player for listening to podcasts while I was out on long walks. It came with an MP3 player, but as any dedicated podcast listener will know, there are a few additional features you need for a good podcast player:

* Automatic "bookmarking" to return to the same position when you leave and return to a track
* The ability to easily skip backward a few seconds for when you hear something repeated.
* The ability to easily skip forward a few seconds for when there's an ad
* Protection against accidentally skipping to the next track with a single button press, thus losing your position in the middle of a 90-minute track
* The ability to read [Rockbox](http://www.rockbox.org) bookmark files, for when you swap the SD card out of your Rockbox-flashed player into your phone (well maybe that's just me)

So I sat down to write an MP3 player that could do this. This code is the result of that attempt. I got it to a crude
working prototype, but I ran up against some mysterious difficulty reading the bookmark files generated by my Rockbox
player, and then I ran out of steam.

Now I have an Android phone, so I probably won't be revisiting this project. But in case anyone might find it useful,
here it is, licensed under the GPL3.

You'll probably need the Nokia Series 40 SDK to be able to download this, which you should be able to get from somewhere under developers.nokia.com. Currently I see it at this URL: http://developer.nokia.com/downloads/P20

I've also included a compiled version of the application in the [/dist directory](https://github.com/agwells/aaplayer/tree/master/dist) of this git repo, so if you don't want to build it yourself
you can try installing that.
